# unity-gamejam-utilities
Tiny set of utilities the help get started with gamejams.

This is what you should expect from it.
 - It should be easy to use from an empty Unity project
 - The code is not especially efficient
 - Ok in the short term, but risky in the long term (very few safety checks, usage of MonoBehaviours and Updates, etc)

The project also serves as a test of how to bundle a Unity package to be imported via the Package Manager.

I followed [the documentation found here](https://nagachiang.github.io/tutorial-working-with-custom-package-in-unity-2019-2/).
